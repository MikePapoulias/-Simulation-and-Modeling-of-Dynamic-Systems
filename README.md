Estimation of unknown parameters of a system using the least squares method, the gradient method and the Lyapunov method.

# Description

In this project, we aim to estimate unknown but constant parameters of various systems using specific methods, namely the least squares method, the gradient method, and the Lyapunov method. The system dynamics are simulated in the Matlab environment. The project is divided into two parts.

In the first part, the goal is to estimate unknown parameters using the least squares method. For this purpose, a mass-spring-damper system and an RLC electrical circuit are initially provided, some of whose parameters are unknown. The task is to determine the values of these unknown parameters after linearly parameterizing each system and analytically expressing their dynamic behavior using differential equations.

The second part focuses on the online estimation of unknown parameters using the gradient and Lyapunov methods. For the first- and second-order systems provided (with unknown constants), we are tasked with designing real-time estimators of parallel and mixed structures.

The implemented graphical representations clarify and verify the theoretical results, which are discussed in the accompanying reports.pdf files.
